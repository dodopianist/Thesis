	abstract = {"Academic Mayer-Schönberger and editor Cukier consider big data the new ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw conclusions from it. Big data is about predictions: math applied to large quantities of data in order to infer probabilities. Because big data allows us to analyze far more data, we will move beyond expecting exactness and can no longer be fixated on causation. The authors state, The correlations may not tell us precisely why something is happening, but they alert us that it is happening. For individuals, big data risks an invasion of privacy, as vast amounts of personal data are collected and the potential exists to accuse a person of some possible future behavior that has not happened. The authors conclude that big data is a tool that doesn't offer ultimate answers, just good-enough ones to help us now until better methods and hence better answers come along. This book offers important insights and information for many library patrons."--Mary Whaley, Booklist.},

	abstract = {The Ecclesiastical Province of Cambrai may sound unfamiliar to modern readers. The bishopric of Cambrai dates to the sixth century but only became an archdiocese and, consequently, the centre of a church province in the sixteenth century. The elevation of the see resulted from the heavily contested reorganization of the diocesan map of the Low Countries by King Philip {II} in 1559. The new province included the medieval sees of Arras, Cambrai and Tournai, as well as the newly created bishoprics of Saint-Omer and Namur. Its borders were established to encompass the French-speaking Walloon provinces in the south of the Low Countries, territories that are now divided between France and Belgium.1 In the early modern period, this area was already a border and transit zone between France, the Low Countries, the Holy Roman Empire and the British Isles. The province’s history in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was deeply marked by recurrent and devastating warfare between the kings of Spain and France, eventually resulting in the transfer of significant territory to France.2 However, the Province of Cambrai was also the scene of frequent cross-border mobility, and a safe haven for Catholic exiles originating from the British Isles, France and other parts of the Low Countries.},

It is argued that religious book production represents an illuminating case for the study of these interactions between Catholics across, along, and beyond borders. From this perspective, the continental production process of English Catholic books rather testifies to the "transregional" character of early modern Catholicism as a whole, rather than to English Catholicism's specific "international" orientation.},

	abstract = {This book focuses on how historical memory and political discourse affected land settlement and political processes in early Restoration Ireland. The period 1660-1667 was one of insecurity for the Protestant plantation in Ireland, as Catholic spokesmen undermined the Protestant status quo. The Stuart Restoration and the English in Ireland draws out the dynamism of the rhetorical, moral andlegal challenges that Catholics made to Protestant power in Ireland and examines the Protestant responses and the rise of a Protestant identity inextricably linked with the possession of power. This identity was expressed as that of the 'English in Ireland', a belligerent self-denomination which did little to accommodate the king or the importance of monarchy to the Protestant position in the country. Crossing boundaries of political, intellectual and cultural history, the book highlights the complexity of political culture in Restoration Ireland, which was defined by the intersection of political language, ideas, historical understandings and economic imperatives. {DANIELLE} {McCORMACK} is Assistant Professor at the Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Adam {MickiewiczUniversity}, Poznan, Poland.},

Bastard feudal Catholicism carried on the tradition of private allegiance \& war with neighbors \& the gov; it was doomed to failure. In seigneurial Catholicism the integration of religion into the household brought the advantages of control over the priest \& freedom from civil \& ecclesiastical supervision. It established the loyalty to the household as superior to all other loyalties \& confirmed the position of the gentleman as mediator between his- dependants \& public authority.

	title = {Women and Work in Early Modern Printing Houses. Family Firms in Antwerp, Douai and Leuven (1500-1700).},
	abstract = {The early modern printing and publishing business was a man's world. The new technology of the printing press was associated with men's work, due to considerable start-up costs and associations with skilled work, literacy, and learned men. Why then, did early modern title pages regularly name women-led businesses as their place of production? This dissertation investigates how women participated in the production and sale of rare books and prints and what structures shaped their possibilities to work as typographers. By using insights from the growing historiography on women's work, I contribute to an ongoing re-examination of male-centred narratives in book history, where women are often only cast as helpmates of master typographers or as absent owners.
The dissertation compares evidence from three towns in the early modern Low Countries: metropolitan Antwerp and the university towns Leuven and Douai. As women were in all probability excluded from wage work in printing houses, women typographers always gained access to the trade through familial ties. Printing houses were family firms which relied on the labour of family members of both sexes. I analyse how gender, family, and institutions shaped women's economic possibilities in the printing house and how women utilised these options.
The first three chapters analyse the familial context of women's work from three vantage points: the education and work of (unmarried) daughters, the role of the book trade in printing families' economic activities and marital choices, and women's ownership of print-related assets. While women probably did not pull the press, they participated in a wide range of activities in printing houses, ranging from running errands and aiding proof-readers as daughters to managing the workforce and making editorial decisions as widows. The education of printing families' daughters was geared towards immediate usefulness in the family business and acquiring skills transferable to other types of businesses, such as bookkeeping. These transferable skills were useful in an economy in which most individuals and families combined multiple sources of income. While the cultural status of the book has often led scholars to focus primarily on book production, the evidence from printing families demonstrates that women combined many different economic activities in their day-to-day work routines, which suggests that they could support the publication of higher risk editions by providing for their families in other ways. Similarly, their choice of marital partner was equally more diverse than often acknowledged by book historians, including exogamous marriage partners. The third chapter compares the property rights of widows and daughters. While egalitarian inheritance practices meant that daughters received equal shares in their parents' estate, printing families were inclined to gear their print specific assets towards sons. In contrast, typographers' widows often had large claims on the estate, resulting in a stronger bargaining position to negotiate financial structures and work relations with their family members.
Chapters four and five move outside the family firm to investigate the status of widows and their relationships with the institutional landscape of print in the Low Countries. As the historiography on women's work has demonstrated, the widows' right to continue their husbands' workshops reflected a shared framework for women's participation in artisan production in many craft trades, but the case of the book trades shows that this system expanded beyond guilds to include universities and governments as well. This meant that widow typographers represented their businesses to the outside world and were held responsible for its publications. Evidence from court cases and petitions shows that they knew how to navigate their institutions when needed.

Approaching book history with insights from social and women's history adds to the historical understanding of book production by taking women seriously as historical actors.

While guidelines exist for algorithm selection and outcome evaluation, there are no firmly established ways of computing a priori statistical power for cluster analysis. Here, we estimated power and classification accuracy for common analysis pipelines through simulation. We systematically varied subgroup size, number, separation (effect size), and covariance structure. We then subjected generated datasets to dimensionality reduction approaches (none, multi-dimensional scaling, or uniform manifold approximation and projection) and cluster algorithms (k-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward or average linkage and Euclidean or cosine distance, {HDBSCAN}). Finally, we directly compared the statistical power of discrete (k-means), “fuzzy” (c-means), and finite mixture modelling approaches (which include latent class analysis and latent profile analysis).},

	abstract = {Henricus Hondius published a French edition of Mercator's Atlas in 1633. This included over 100 new or updated maps compared to the French edition of 1628 (and our Latin edition of 1623). "As a service for owners of the last French edition of 1628 (1:114) he published the new maps also separately as L 'Appendice (1:312). For the old maps in the new edition he used the same signatures and page numbers as in the 1628 edition. The new maps have signatures and page numbers which are repeated signatures and numbers of the 1628 edition, to make it easier to insert the new maps in the old edition. For instance, the map of Lothian has to be placed between the second and third map of Scotland, with signatures 2E and 2F and page numbers 109-112 and 113-116 respectively. The new map is given the signature 2E2 and the repeated page numbers 109-112. As a consequence, the new complete edition has odd signatures. The Paris {BGen} copy is obviously completed this way, having the half.title and preface of the Appendix added in volume 2 and still Mercator's title page of the 1628 edition. ." (Van der Krogt 1:312). These 104 maps are the last group of new maps when compared to our 1607 and 1623 editions of the atlas.},

The authors focus on the initial Confederacy of the Middle Ages; the religious divisions which threatened it after 1500 and its surprising survival amongst Europe's monarchies; the turmoil following the French Revolution and conquest, which continued until the Federal Constitution of 1848; the testing of the Swiss nation through the late nineteenth century and then two World Wars and the Depression of the 1930s; and the unparalleled economic and social growth and political success of the post-war era.

By focussing on the border regions of the Spanish Habsburg Low Countries, and by exploring interactions in and beyond these borderlands, the chapters shed light on how humans in the past created, handled and surpassed the territorial boundaries they encountered. This approach reveals how early modern borders functioned not only as areas of communication and movement, but also as barriers that hindered or impeded cross-border exchanges.00Looking at the Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern border regions of the Habsburg Netherlands, as well as to the connections between the Netherlands, Spain and their neighbours, the volume connects the boundaries of the Low Countries to a variety of important issues of the time. These contemporary questions included matters of conflict and negotiation, commerce and confession, and loyalty and identity. As such, the variety offered by the transregional methodology applied in this volume, results in a much better understanding of the uniting and dividing aspects of early modern territoriality.},

This contribution argues that (1) the frontier position of the Ecclesiastical Province of Cambrai led to (2) systematic encounters between Catholic exiles of diverse regional provenances. Rather than solely seeking to establish segregated exile communities, as argued in older nationalist historiographies, (3) these refugees interacted with their host society, and inscribed themselves in pre-existing patterns of cross-border mobility with France. As such, the Cambrai borderlands came to constitute a transregional node within the Catholic Reformation of the early modern era.},

Using the central limit theorem, a variety of parametric tests have been developed under assumptions about the parameters that determine the population probability distribution. Compared to non-parametric tests, which do not require any assumptions about the population probability distribution, parametric tests produce more accurate and precise estimates with higher statistical powers. However, many medical researchers use parametric tests to present their data without knowledge of the contribution of the central limit theorem to the development of such tests. Thus, this review presents the basic concepts of the central limit theorem and its role in binomial distributions and the Student's t-test, and provides an example of the sampling distributions of small populations. A proof of the central limit theorem is also described with the mathematical concepts required for its near-complete understanding.},

	abstract = {The ecclesiastical province of Cambrai, roughly covering the French speaking southern regions of the Habsburg Netherlands, attracted in the second half of the sixteenth century a significant number of Catholic exiles, both from more northern regions in the Netherlands and from the British Isles.Transregional mobility and migration affected the then swiftly emerging Catholic printing business in this border region, located in the university city of Douai and the major cities of Mons and Arras, and temporarily Lille. At first sight, the printing presses produced a predictable output of Latin and vernacular (i.c. French) items. In fact, the political troubles - including a temporal expulsion of English Catholics - clearly slowed down the printing of English works. Still, towards the end of the sixteenth century, an impressive number of French translations of Mediterranean religious literature were printed in Douai and Arras. This 'hidden' multilingualism was the precursor of the clearly multilingual press that developed in the seventeenth century. This contribution analyses the conditions under which the 'hidden' multilingualism occurred in Cambrai. The transregional networks of printers and publishers as well as of church people and city officials reflected the position of Cambrai as an intermediary zone between print capitals such as Antwerp or Paris in the context of religious migration following religious and political upheaval.},

Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3236502},
	abstract = {In Late-Medieval panel paintings from the Tuscan area, mechanical tools called punches were used to impress repeated motifs on gold foils to create decorative patterns. Such patterns can be used as clues to objectively support the attribution of the paintings, as proposed by art historian Erling S. Skaug in his decades-long study on punches. We investigate the feasibility of employing automatic pattern recognition techniques for accelerating the process of classification of punches by experts working in the field. We propose a system composed of (a) a Convolutional Neural Network for categorizing a punch contained in a frame, and (b) an additional component for uncertainty estimation, aimed at recognizing possible Out-of-Distribution ({OOD}) samples. After collecting a set of 14th century panel paintings from Tuscany, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which achieves very high test-set accuracy. As far as the uncertainty estimation is concerned, we experiment with two techniques, {OpenGAN} and {II}-loss, both exhibiting very positive results. The former seems to work better on specific data extracted from images of panel paintings, while the latter showcases a more consistent behavior when considering additional {OOD} data obtained randomly. These outcomes indicate that an application of our system in support of experts is feasible, although we subsequently show that additional experiments on larger datasets might be required.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis ({SNA}), in essence, is not a formal theory in social science, but rather an approach for investigating social structures, which is why {SNA} is often referred to as structural analysis [1]. The most important difference between social network analysis and the traditional or classic social research approach is that the contexts of the social actor, or the relationships between actors are the first considerations of the former, while the latter focuses on individual properties. A social network is a group of collaborating, and/or competing individuals or entities that are related to each other. It may be presented as a graph, or a multi-graph; each participant in the collaboration or competition is called an actor and depicted as a node in the graph theory. Valued relations between actors are depicted as links, or ties, either directed or undirected, between the corresponding nodes. Actors can be persons, organizations, or groups – any set of related entities. As such, {SNA} may be used on different levels, ranging from individuals, web pages, families, small groups, to large organizations, parties, and even to nations.},

Even focusing on a particular scientific field, the rate of new publications far outpaces even the most studious historian’s research capacity. This essay summarizes an approach to this problem that uses computational techniques of network analysis. As a complement to close analysis of particular documents, network analysis can give a large-scale perspective on the history of science, identifying relational patterns across a vast number of documents that might otherwise require an entire career to digest. To demonstrate the power of the approach, the essay applies network theory to a corpus of publications in evolutionary medicine. Four distinct networks, including those focused on authors, keywords, and citations, quickly unearth a range of relevant historical information. The essay illustrates how interpretable historical conclusions are drawn from a variety of quantitative metrics. The aim is to provide an overview of network techniques for historians looking to add robust network analysis to their research repertoire.},
